# 🚗 CO2 Emissions Prediction Using Vehicle Data

This project analyzes a dataset of 7,385 vehicles to predict **CO2 emissions (g/km)** using various vehicle attributes. By applying **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and a **linear regression model**, the goal is to understand the key factors influencing emissions and develop a predictive model with high accuracy.
